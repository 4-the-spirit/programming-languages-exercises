# programming-languages-exercises
ðŸ”£ Implementations of key programming language features using Scheme, developed in the Programming Languages (20905) course.

# Introduction
This repository contains implementations of various programming language features that were part of the exercises in the **Programming Languages (20905)** course. All the exercises are implemented in **Scheme.** Throughout this course, I gained a deep practical understanding of the distinction between **Concrete** and **Abstract Syntax** in programming languages, as well as how interpreters evaluate different types of expressions. Beginning with simple expressions like if-expressions and map-expressions, I progressed to more complex constructs such as **multi-parameter procedures, procedure calls, assignment expressions,** and beyond. Through these hands-on implementations, my comprehension of programming languages has significantly deepened, especially in understanding concepts like Environments, References, and other critical programming language features.
